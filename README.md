# Makefile-Generator
I wrote a bunch of Python scripts to make your life easier when creating Make files.

Check out the "docs/" for the instructions to:  
    Set up this script(s)               ("setup.md")  
    Use this script(s)                  ("usage.md")  
    Make your life even more exiting    ("extra.md")  
    Get dependencies for this script(s) ("dependencies.md")
