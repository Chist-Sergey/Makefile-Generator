# Makefile-Generator
I wrote a bunch of Python scripts to make your life easier when creating Make files.

Check out the "docs/" for the instructions to:  
        Set up this script(s)                               ([setup.md](docs/setup.md))  
        Use this script(s)                                  ([usage.md](docs/usage.md))  
        Make your life even more exiting        ([extra.md](docs/extra.md))  
        Get dependencies for this script(s)    ([dependencies.md](docs/dependencies.md))
