I recommend you to add a shortcut to "make" command,  
so you could type something simple like "m v"  
to open your Visual Sudio Code appplication.  
(if the file is't listed, then create it)  

To do so, add an **alias m="make"** to:  

    macOS  
        ~/.bash_profile  
            or  
        ~/.zsh_profile  
    Windows:  
        It's complicated.

    Linux:  
        ~/.bashrc  
            or  
        ~/.zshrc  
    Fish:  
        ~/.config/fish/config.fish
